# ecwid-extra-fields

---

 **TODO:** 
 For tomorrow. 

 1. Save the selected option "values" in Ecwid so it would be possible to pass it in the MS. 
 2. Override fields when other shipping option is selected. 
    2.1. Test it with different info showing in the options menu. Could be dummy info too. 
 3. Think of a better way of testing everything. At the moment to go through entire pipeline and then be able to test is way too long.  
    3.1. Possible to test locally? Talk with Ecwid API support. 
 4. How to get Shipping options data from Ecwid/MS? 
    4.1. With shipping options data we could override options select to correct one's in options.  
    4.1. Need to talk with Saulius on this one.
